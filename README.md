# Godot OpenVR FPS

![](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.1/_images/starter_vr_tutorial_sword.png)

This repository contains the source and other related files for the Godot VR starter tutorial, which can be found here:
https://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/tutorials/vr/vr_starter_tutorial.html

The tutorial covers how to create a first person shooter (FPS) VR game in Godot using GDscript. The project on this repository is the finished result of the Godot tutorial.

### Safety notice

Virtual Reality (VR) can cause seizures, discomfort, and other problems for some individuals. **Take breaks when required and follow the health and safety warnings for your Virtual Reality headset!**

## Project Features

* VR locomotion through teleportation and artificial movement.
  * Point and teleport locomotion by pressing the trigger while not holding any objects. This locomotion snaps the player instantly to the new position.
  * Artificial movement locomotion by moving the VR joystick and/or touch-pad. This locomotion 'moves' the player through 3D space, applying a slight vignette to reduce motion sickness.
* A RigidBody-based 3D object interaction system that uses the VR controllers.
  * Pick up, drop, and throw both normally RigidBody and Rigidbody-derived nodes.
  * Pick up objects using either with an Area node or a Raycast node.
* Interact with specially coded RigidBody-based objects.
  * Currently the project has: pistols, a shotgun, a sword, and some simple bombs.
  * There are simple targets that break into pieces when damaged.
* 3D UI with in-game instructions.
* The project *should* work with all major VR headsets.
* And more!
